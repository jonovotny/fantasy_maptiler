[![A simple example map](demo.png "Click for a demo")](https://jonovotny.github.io/map.html)

## Features

* Images can be placed and scaled independently, e.g. to place detail maps into a overall world map
* Automatically generated Leaflet layers, allowing users to toggle the visibility of individual map images
* Customizable zoom options for each layer, e.g. to only show detail maps at zoom levels at which they are legible
* (optional) Preliminary image filter support to create an 'underground' effect using a drop shadow
* (optional) A measuring tool with user-controllable size scale to allow accurate distance measurements
* (optional) Ability to parse marker information from a remote html source (client side processing to avoid the need for dynamic webhosting), e.g. to create city labels and quest markers.

## Requirements

* [Python 3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/) (developed with 3.7.4)
* Additional Python modules: [numpy](https://numpy.org/), [PIL](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/)

## Instructions

To create the example project run the following command on Commandline or PowerShell:

```
python maptiler.py -c example.json
```

Check the Json configuration file ([example.json](https://github.com/jonovotny/fantasy_maptiler/blob/master/example.json)) for customization options.

## Configuration

```
{
"map_name": "Isla del Craneo",		
	The name of the map, used in the title of the generated webpage
"map_levels_min": 1,
	The minimum zoom level available on the generated leaflet map (default 0)
"map_levels_max": 4,
	The maximum zoom level available on the generated leaflet map (default 4)
	Due to some implementation limitations it is recommended to stay below map_max_levels 6. 

"tile_size": 512,
	Size of tiles images are cut into in pixels (default 512). It is recommended to choose either 512 or 256.
"default_lat": -256,
"default_lng": 256,
"default_zoom": 1,
	default_lat, _lng and _zoom define the map view used when the map is loaded

"distance_tool_enabled": true,
	Adds the measurement to the map (button with ruler symbol, top left)
"distance_tile_size": 100,
	Size of the top level tile (i.e. tile_size) in map units
"distance_settings": {
	Internal settings of the Leaflet.LinearMeasurement.js plugin
	
	"color": "#b51d21",
		Color of the measuring line and tooltip
	"unitSystem": "imperial",
		The unit system defining UNIT and SUB_UNIT. Options are "metric" [km/m], "imperial" [mi/ft] or "custom".
	"unitSystem_custom": {
		If "custom" was chosen as unitSystem, these options allow setting unit conversion between main and minor unit and unit names
		
		"UNIT_CONV": 1,
			Keep this setting at 1 (conversion between internal scale and map scale should be defined in "distance_tile_size")
		"SUB_UNIT_CONV": 1980,
		"UNIT": "furlong",
		"SUB_UNIT": "hand"
	}
},

"marker_tool_enabled": true,
	Adds the link generation tool to the map (button with marker symbol, top left)
	Clicking on the map drops a marker on the map. The tooltip attached to the map encodes it's location and zoom level 
	based on the "marker_string_format"
	This can be used to generate links that zoom in on specific map locations.
	
"marker_string_format": "&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jonovotny.github.io/map.html?lat={0}&amp;lng={1}&amp;level={2}&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;",
	An example format string. To generate links html characters need to be escaped (e.g. use &lt; instead of <)
	Within the string {0} is replaced by the markers latitude, {1} byt the markers longitude and {2} by the current map zoom level.

"source_path": "sourcemaps",
	The directory containing source map images relative to the python script execution directory
"output_path": "example",
	The output directory relative to the python script execution directory
	This directory will be overwritten whenever a new map is generated.

"layers": [
	This list defines all layers that are available in the generated map (button with layer symbol, top left)
	Layers are defined by the following attributes:
	
	{
		"name": "Isla del Craneo",
			The "name" is used as the entry name in the layer dropdown menu
		"type": "base",
			"base" layers should fill the entire map area, only one base layer can be shown at a time.
		"defaultVisible": true,
			The default visibility state of a layer when the map is loaded
		"maps": [
			This list defines the image sources used to build this layer. It is possible to combine multiple images into one layer.
			Entries of this list must exist in the "sourcemaps" settings below.
			
			"Isla del Craneo"
		]
	},
	{
		"name": "Port Dental",
		"type": "overlay",
			"overlay" layers usually cover a smaller area of the entire map and can be toggled on and off
		"defaultVisible": true,
		"maps": [
			An example of combining multiple detail maps into a single layer. 
			Images are combined into a composite image in the order they appear on this list.
		
			"Port Dental", 
			"Lone Tree Island"
		],
		"minlevel": 2
			The minimum zoom level for this layer, it will not be visible while zoomed out further (zoom level 0 and 1 in this example)
			This can be used to hide the map if it is not legible while zoomed out.
	},
	{
		"name": "Nasal Cavities",
		"type": "overlay",
		"defaultVisible": false,
		"maps": [
			"Nasal Cavities"
		],
		"minlevel": 2
	},
	{
		"name": "Quests",
		"type": "overlay",
		"defaultVisible": true,
			Layers without map images can be used to toggle the visibility of text labels and markers (quest symbols in this example)
		"minlevel": 0
	}
],
"sourcemaps": {
	This list defines where source images should be placed within the world map.
	
	"Isla del Craneo": {
		The name of each entry has to the one used in the "maps" lists of layer entries above.
		
		"path": "exemplaria.png",
			The name of the source image file within the previously defined "source_path" directory.
		"origin": [
			Origin and scale at which the image should place within the map.
			
			0,	X location of the bottom left corner of the image within the "inputlevel" in pixels. The coordinate origin is bottom left.
			0	Y location of the bottom left corner of the image within the "inputlevel" in pixels.
		],
		"scale": 1.0,
			Image scale factor.
		"inputlevel": 0
			The level at which the image is inserted in the image pyramid. The image size at a given level is (2^level)*tile_size.
			E.g. a world map with a resolution of 2048*2048 pixels should be inserted at level 2 (2^2*512) in this example, to avoid a loss of quality.
	},
	"Port Dental": {
		"path": "portdental.png",
		"origin": [
			218,
			232
		],
		"scale": 0.1555,
		"inputlevel": 0
			Defining origin and scale of detail layers on the same level as the world map makes it easier to get the placement right.
	},
	"Lone Tree Island": {
		"path": "lonetree.png",
		"origin": [
			278,
			334
		],
		"scale": 0.04,
		"inputlevel": 0
	},
	"Nasal Cavities": {
		"path": "nasalcavity.png",
		"origin": [
			218,
			232
		],
		"scale": 0.1555,
		"inputlevel": 0,
		"filters": [
			Filters are applied to the image before tiling happens. Currently one a cutout filter is available, 
			but it is possible to add custom filters to maptiler.py. Filters are applied to the image before scaling and
			in the order they appear in the following list.
			The dictionary of options will be passed to the filter implementation as arguments. 
			
			{						 
				"type": "cutout",
					The cutout filter grows a border around all features of the image that are different from the provided background image.
					It also has an option to create a drop shadow effect to indicate that the cutout lies below the surrounding areas. 
				"bgpath": "nasalcavitybg.png",
					The background map used to find features of interest in the source image. 
				"expand": 50,
					The extent of the border created around identified features in pixel
				"pixel_threshold": 20,
					The threshold defining when a pixel is considered different from the background (to avoid problems with image compression artifacts)
				"shadow_offset": [
					The shadow offset in pixels. (use [0,0] for no shadow)
					10,
					-10
				],
				"shadow_blur": 5
					The Gaussian blur applied to the shadow in pixels.
			}
		]
	}
},
"labelsources": [
	This list defines location, parsing parameters and display options for labels stored in a seperate web document.
	This allows editing label text and locations without the need to change the map html file 
	(e.g. by storing label data in a wiki that can be accessed by players of an RPG campaign).
	Labels are processed client-side, which avoids the need of dynamic webhosting.
	
	{
		"id": "SourceA",
		"type": "html",
			Defines which method is used to fetch the remote document. Currently only html documents are supported.
			Trying to load http sources while hosting the map on https might cause problems.
			Html label lists may only have a single label group divider or label per line.
			
		"url": "https://jonovotny.github.io/labelexample.html",
			The web location of the label list. 
			In this example the label list is structured as follows:
			
			<h2>Worldmap Labels</h2> 
				Label groups are separated by html h2 headers.
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://jonovotny.github.io/map.html?lat=-158.25&lng=305.5&level=2">Mt. Sinister</a></li>
					Label location and text are encoded as html links.
			</ul>
			
			Other ways of parsing the html data can be defined by changing the various search tokens below.			
			
		"txtTokens": ["\">", "</a"],
			The tokens defining start and end of the label's text content. 
			Quotation marks in the token have to be preceded by a backslash (i.e. \").
			In the example link above this would parse (start token ">) Mt. Sinister ("</a" end token)
		"ignoreTokens": ["<del>", "\\*\\*"],
			If these tokens are found in a line, the line will be ignored even if it contains a valid label definition.
			This is useful to keep entries in a list (e.g. completed quests) without them showing up on the map.
		"latToken": "lat=",
		"lngToken": "lng=",
			The Latitude and Longitude tokens are required to define the marker location and both need to be present in a line to create a label.
			The parser attempts to read a decimal number starting right after the defined text token.
		"levelToken": "level=",
			This token is optional and used to define at which zoomlevel of the map if accessed via an external link (e.g. in labelexample.html)
		"layerToken": "layer=",
			This token is optional and not yet implemented. It defines a list of layers that should be enabled when the map is accessed via an 
			external link (e.g. in labelexample.html)
		"groupTokens": ["<h2>","</h2>"],
		"groups": {
			"Worldmap Labels": {
